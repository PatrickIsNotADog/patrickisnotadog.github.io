I started blogging after 1 year of professional experience as a Java developer and as a result of my need to concentrate knowledge about programming, describe it in a clear, well-formed shape and make it easy for others to read and understand. It was a need to communicate knowledge and information.

Later, I realized another need: to talk about code, to think and discuss about programming and good practices. Creating and contributing to code projects are great to improve your skills, master a new language or a new tech trend, but in order to be a better programmer, you have to take a step back once in a while and think about the code you are writing, the applications you are developing. This blog, is my step back, the place where I can share not only technical knowledge, but also my ideas about deeper programming concepts, that remain the same, no matter how technical trends change.

After some time thinking about code, you will be able to create a new project, experiment with new techniques you have learned, identify and implement some design patterns you have read about. A never ending loop, which involves coding, experimenting, making mistakes and then taking a step back to think about all these and then start again. Reminds me a lot of Escherâ€™s drawing hands.

The place where I share my code is [Github](https://github.com/alkarn). This blog is built on top of [Dean Attali's great template](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Although Alex is my real name, Karnezis is not. I created a nickname to protect my anonymity, while I shared what I think is the most important: knowledge on programming areas, thoughts about coding, my projects. Maybe, I was influenced a bit by Alkis Alkaios, my favourite contemporary lyricist, who also used a nickname and let people know little about him except his work. Maybe it is a reaction to the ubiquitous presence of *social media*, the notion of *internet id* itself; how obvious it seems for people to know who you socialize with, your vacation, the place you work. You will not find me on Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter etc., but you can communicate with using the email below and through my Github profile.

Thank you for reading :)
