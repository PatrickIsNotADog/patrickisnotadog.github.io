Maybe a post where I can organize the things I did in order to be able to work on a side project, while my full job was moving extremely instensfully.

## Organize your tasks

It really helped me today to open a note first, write my thoughts about the project and then two tasks that I would be glad to see them done the same, or the next day. Hopefully the tasks were finished the same day, so I had time to write some more thoughts and prepare two more tasks for the next day I occupy myself again with the project.

Will see how this works.

## Minimize distractions

This is clearly personal for every person, but I closed all the sites I like to spend time on (e.g. 9gag) until I stopped working on the project. Also, had music playing in the room; sort of helps me concentrate.
