> Compass: an instrument containing a magnetized pointer that shows the direction of magnetic north and bearings from it.

I use this word metaphorically, as a set of *axioms* I have created for myself, statements that contain a truth I deeply believe
in, and I consult them every time I take a decision; this way the effect of my decisions can point to a specific direction.

My *compasses* that far are:

* I want to be happy and enjoy life. I do not need or want a luxurious life (e.g. I do not want the super, fast, latest sport car;
I prefer a nice sedan).

* In order to be happy, the people around me I care the most must be happy as well, both in their personal lives and in the
relationship they have with me.

* In order to be happy, I have to always be occupied with a job, unless I choose not to have one.

* The profession I work on is a *bubble*, that can burst at any time.
