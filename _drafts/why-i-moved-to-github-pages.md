When I decided I [should start blogging](aboutme), I did not think a lot about where my blog would be hosted. Nor the format my posts would be nice to have. I just opened a gedit editor, made myself a warm cup of coffee and started typing my [first welcome post](welcome). I had already played around with WordPress as a student, so it seemed to me like a nice, free place to host my blog.
