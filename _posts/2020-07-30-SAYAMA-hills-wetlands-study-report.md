### 1. Introduction
This report is about wetlands in Sayama-hills area, which is located about 40km northwest of central Tokyo, 
stretching northwest of Tokyo and southwest of Saitama Prefecture. It is about 11km wide and 4km long. 
The area contains a spectacular forest and two reservoirs named Lake Sayama and Lake Tama. 
My field trip took place on July 19. The weather was sunny, and the average temperature was about 30 degrees.

### 2. Wetland Ecosystem
**Biodiversity**

Sayama-hills has so far identified more than 1,000 higher plants, 1,000 insects and 210 bird species. 
There are many kinds of flowers in the Sayama-hill and different scenery can be seen throughout the year. 
In spring, the Japanese andromeda, Japanese snowball, various species of cherry blossom are in full bloom. 
The Ophiopogon planiscapus in figure 1, Lysimachus clethroides, Agrimonia japonica are the common flowers to be seen in Summer. 
Fall is the season for persicaria filiformis, miscanthus sinensis and for all kinds of fall foliage such as ginkgo, Japanese maple, 
trident maple, Japanese zelkova, Japanese horse-chestnut, dawn redwood and clethra. Besides, seeds and fruit ripen in fall, 
for instance, you could find Quercus serrata Quercus serrata, Platanus, Japanese Beautyberry and Cornus kousa. In winter, 
there are also flowers to see here in Sayama-hills. 
The typical ones are flowerhead of pertya scandens and all types of winter buds such as Japanese horse-chestnut, 
Lyonia ovalifolia, neziki and clethra. Many common birds can be seen in the forest, such as the Japanese green woodpecker, 
pheasant and Chinese bamboo partridge, as well as the cuckoo and small cuckoo rarely seen in urban areas.

**Ecosystem Uniqueness**

The Sayama-hills area is home to a rare bird called the Goshawk as shown in figure 2. 
I did not see a living body during this field trip. According to the data form Mizuho town Library, 
the Goshawk has the standing height between 50cm to 57cm and the wingspan is between 105cm to 130cm. 
Residents of Mizuho can see goshawks flying over the town all year round. 
And records show that they caught chickens from private houses and chased pigeons into houses.

Sayama tea is a local specialty, and you can find tea plants grown by residents in many places as shown in figure 3. In 1875, the Sayama Corporation, 
a privately owned company, began exporting tea to the United States. The name Sayama Tea was first identified around this time. 
Sayama tea is a tea that has been specially bred for its string cold resistance characteristic. 
The tea leaves evolved into dense shape to defend cold weather. The tea extracted from the thick leaves has a distinctive sweetness and rich 
flavor and contains high levels of beneficial antioxidants.

**Wetland Water Resources Protection**

There are two main lakes used as reservoirs in Sayama-hills. Sayama Lake also called as Yamaguchi Reservoir; another is Tama lake also named as Marayama Reservoir as shown in figure 4. These two neighboring man-made lakes supporting water resources for Tokyo. They are important sources of water for Tokyo Metropolitan Watercourse Authority. The concrete dam in the reservoir was first built during the Pacific War, and the seismic reinforcement project was implemented from 2003 to 2009. 
For more protection of water resources, except from the concrete dam body, it is surrounded by green vegetation. avoiding water pollution in residential and commercial areas. Several water towers are set up on the lake surface. Staff can directly walk to the water tower from the bridges for operation, which facilitates the operation of monitoring.

### 3. Public Science Education
**Science Popularization And Education Facilities**

Tokyo Metropolitan Mizuho Nōgei High School which located at the edge of Sayama-hills has specific education on livestock, gardening and landscape. There are special animal farms and greenhouse plantations built around the school as shown in figure 5 and figure 6. Recently, due to the impact of the epidemic, many activities in the school cannot be carried out, the school's official website can also see the staff took photos of the farm and greenhouse of animals and plants.

Sayama-hills is a historical battlefield from the Kamakura Period (12th to 14th centuries), it also has the remnants of the Jomon Period. You can find historical temples and shrines like Toyokashima Shrine as shown in figure 7. The national treasure “Jizoudo” can also be seen throughout the area.

**Science Popularization And Education Activities**

Nearby schools hold tree-watching activities in various forests around Sun Square. The woods contain trees such as trident maple, pine forests and other mixed forests. The red pine, a Japanese red pine, has a very beautiful bark. There are many kinds of birds, which are very suitable for bird watching activities. During my field trip, it is common to hear many birds call for part of the reason that it is breeding season.

According to Sayama park website, there are many events and exhibitions every year. This year there has been no activity since February due to COVID-19, but last year there were a series of very interesting activities including “insect exhibitions”, “bird watching in winter”, “children looking for lives in the mountains” as shown in figure 8, and “puzzles of tree bark”.

The Hachikokuyama in the Sayama-Hills area was designated as a wide area refuge and two disaster prevention toilets were set up (Heisei 25 years) for the "Hachikokuyama Disaster Prevention Day". Under the sponsorship of Higashimurayama, Tokorozawa, Tokyo Fire Department and other agencies, a total of 15 columns were held, including "Father and son's Outdoor disaster prevention skills" and "Experience earthquake emergency rescue implementation experience". As a prize for participation in the disaster relief campaign, "Convenient Rice" and original canning badges were also given out. These activities made many people know that the Hachikokuyama green area is a wide area of refuge and raised people's awareness of disaster prevention.

### 4. Rational Use Of Wetland
**Coordination Of Protection And Utilization**

Sayama hills was developed under the name of urbanization to cut down forests and illegally dump garbage, which caused serious damage to the natural ecology. Since 1990, the Totoro Foundation has been purchasing land and generate Totoro’s forests to protect the ecological environment of Sayama hills. To this day, the foundation has bought more than three dozen plots with the area of land about 48ha.

**Service Facilities**

There are many developed parks, large and small, throughout the hilly area. The Sayama Hill Flora and Fauna Interaction Center is a visitor center and is one of a series of five centers operated by Saitama Prefecture for nature study in the Sayama Hills. The Saitama Midori-no-mori Nature Park is established in 1995 and has showpieces all over the place in the outdoor space, it is also a good place for wetlands outdoor viewing. Municipal Kitayama Park is a lush satoyama landscape extends from Kitayama Park, it is operated by city of Higashimurayama and it is famous for the irises bloom in June as shown in figure 9.

In addition to the park, there is a 21.9km long bike path and walkway called Lake Tama Cycling Road, which runs from Higashimurayama to Sakai Purification Plant in Musashino as shown in figure 10.

**Features Of Landscapes**

The Rokudouyama Park Observatory offers a view of Mount Fuji known as the "Fuji Hundred View" as shown in figure 11. Because it is located on a tenement, you can see the city in the background of Mount Fuji. Nearby hillsides and distant views of Tanzawa and Mount Fuji are all in eyes. Especially on a clear day, in the transparent scenery, you can overlook the magnificent Fuji scenery. This facility is not only for the town people, but also many people come here to enjoy photography, sketching and so on. It is the best place for Fuji to see the scenery. In addition, as the stage of the movie “My Neighbor Totoro”, the pavilion is conveniently located and can be reached by car. The observatory park is 192 meters above sea level. The 13-meter high observatory offers a 360-degree view of the narrow hills and the ever-changing views of Mount Fuji. In this fine weather like field trip, we can see a lot of people gathering to enjoy photography and sketching.

### 5. Management Of Nature Reserves
**Management Policy**

The management and operation of the Sayama-hills area by several municipal governments and the major local park authorities aims to preserve and restore the nature reserve as a hilly area connected by green corridors that cross the borders of the county. In addition, the use of the nature of the hilly park in the mountains, the collaboration with urban residents committed to the preservation of the habitats of animals and plants, through nature to learn and work to promote the importance of nature and other universal inspiration.

As for the local park management, they hold the flexible use of funds that only the folk have and the management viewpoint that takes user satisfaction into account, and establish and practice the "circular park management based on urban co-movement".

**Protection And Restoration Measures**

Hilly terrain is often at risk of mudslides, as is the case in Sayama-hills. Most of the land is covered with vegetation, and the root tissue of trees and bushes holds the soil firmly in place, preventing erosion. But in places with large height gaps, small landslides occur as shown in figure 12, but it occurs at a distance from the sidewalk and pedestrians are safe. It is worth noting that Sayama-Hills was in the danger zone for a disaster during the heavy rain on July 23. In addition to such mobile phone alerts, the park has temporarily closed some muddy mountain roads to prevent dangerous events. On most main pedestrians’ paths along the mountains, two-meter-high iron fences have been built to prevent pedestrians from falling, as well as to prevent the destruction of vegetation.

For the rare birds that live in the mountains, there is a building next to the Rokudouyama Park Observatory belonging to the Poaching Countermeasures Committee and a warning from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police department.

The purpose of vegetation management in this area is aimed to make efforts of the coexistence of utilization and preservation at the same time. To ensure views and overlooks, about 60 new vegetation management (mowing, cutting, etc.) has been implemented to enhance the safety and charm of visitors to the park. The sightseeing scope of the whole park becomes brighter and more beautiful, and the vision becomes more transparent. For the restoration of wetlands, due to the migration of vegetation, the process of landization is accelerated, and the regeneration of wetlands is carried out in the places where exotic plants such as sage flourish significantly.

Experimental areas are set up in wetlands to monitor vegetation and plants. After much discussion with local civic groups, the Gratiola japonica, an aquatic plant rarely seen in Tokyo, and the cryptomeria fortunei, thought to be extinct, germinated, starting with the area where the soil excavation was carried out. Based on this result, the excavation site is now expanded to facilitate the work of wetland regeneration.
